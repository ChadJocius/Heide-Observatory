## Objective
The Eulerâ€™s Disk Model demonstrates the physics of rotational motion, energy conservation, and friction in a visually captivating way. As the heavy disk spins on a mirrored surface, it exhibits a phenomenon known as spolling, where its spin rate increases while the wobbling motion decreases until it comes to a sudden stop. This model helps illustrate fundamental principles of angular momentum, gyroscopic stability, and energy dissipation, offering an engaging hands-on experience that connects physics concepts to real-world observations.
