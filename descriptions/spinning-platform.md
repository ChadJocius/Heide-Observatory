![Spinning Platform](../images/spinning-platform.jpg)

## Objective

The Spinning Platform Experiment allows participants to directly experience rotational motion, angular momentum, and 
conservation of momentum. By using a spinning platform, a bike wheel, and two 5-lb weights, they explore how 
differently distributing mass affects rotational speed.
