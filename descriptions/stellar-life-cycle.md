# Stellar Life Cycle

![Stellar Life Cycle](../images/stellar-life-cycle.jpg)

## Objective

Participants explore and illustrate the different stages of a starâ€™s life cycle by creating a visual representation 
using colored paper cutouts, cotton, and pencils. This hands-on activity helps reinforce the concept of stellar 
evolution, from birth in a nebula to potential endpoints such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.
