# Euler's Disk

![Euler's Disk](../images/eulers-disk.jpg)

## Objective

The Eulerâ€™s Disk Model demonstrates the physics of rotational motion, energy conservation, and friction in a visually 
and auditorially captivating way. As the heavy disk spins on a mirrored surface, it exhibits a phenomenon known as 
spolling, where its spin rate increases while the wobbling motion decreases until it comes to a sudden stop. This model 
helps illustrate fundamental principles of angular momentum, gyroscopic stability, and energy dissipation, 
offering an engaging hands-on experience that connects these concepts to participant observations.
