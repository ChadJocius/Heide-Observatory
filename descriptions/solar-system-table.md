![Solar System Marble Table](../images/solar-system-table.jpg)

## Objective
The Solar System Marble Table Model provides a tangible representation of order of planetary orbits, 
helping participants grasp the connection of planetary observation from Earth and the ordering of the planets and 
select dwarf planets around the Sun in an interactive way. Using marbles of varying sizes to represent planets, this 
model visually demonstrates the scale differences among planets and select dwarf planets. By engaging with the model, 
participants can develop a deeper appreciation for the structure of our solar system.
