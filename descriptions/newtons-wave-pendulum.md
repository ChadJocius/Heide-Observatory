# Newton's Wave Pendulum

![Newton's Wave Pendulum](../images/newtons-pendulum.jpg)

## Objective

Newton’s Wave Pendulum consists of multiple pendulums of different lengths suspended in a row. When all pendulums 
are released simultaneously, they create mesmerizing wave-like motion patterns. These patterns form due to the 
varying periods of oscillation, creating interference effects and wave behavior in real-time. Observers perceive 
directly the dependence of pendulum period on length.
