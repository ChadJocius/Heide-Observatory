## Objective
"Walking the Solar System" is a hands-on, scale-model activity that allows participants to grasp the immense distances between planets by physically walking a proportional distance relative to their actual spacing in space. By scaling down the solar system to a walkable size, students will gain a deeper understanding of planetary orbits, relative distances, and the vastness of our cosmic neighborhood. This interactive experience encourages critical thinking about scale, space travel, and the challenges of exploring our solar system.
