![Newton's Cradle](Newton's-cradle.jpg)
## Objective
Newtonâ€™s Cradle consists of a series of five or more metal balls of equal size, suspended in a row by thin wires or strings. When one or more balls on one side are lifted and released, they swing back down and transfer their energy through the stationary balls, causing the balls on the opposite side to move outward in response.
