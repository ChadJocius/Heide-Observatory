## Objective
Newtonâ€™s Wave Pendulum consists of multiple pendulums of different lengths suspended in a row. When all pendulums are released simultaneously, they create mesmerizing wave-like motion patterns. These patterns form due to the varying periods of oscillation, creating interference effects and wave behavior in real-time.
